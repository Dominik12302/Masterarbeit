Introduction:

For the recent MT measurements across the Hangai Mountains, Mongolia, we used a 
combination of full Mt stations and telluric only recordings. This procedure 
turned out to be very efficient the field. However, it remains questionable, 
under which circumstances the local magnetic fields can be replaced with the 
recordings from a remote station. Obvious pssueds that might be enc ountered are 
effects due to local conductivity anomalies and due to source field effects.
